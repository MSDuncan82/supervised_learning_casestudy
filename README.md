# Case Study: Non-parametric models

In this case study you should use non-parametric supervised learning models you were exposed to in class (such as kNN, decision trees, random forest, boosting) to create a predictive machine learning model.  It may be interesting to compare non-parametric to parametric (linear/logistic regression) results.  

Here are your case study options:  

* [Predict ride-sharing company churn](https://github.com/GalvanizeDataScience/supervised-learning-case-study/blob/Denver/ride-share/case_study_description.md)

* [Predict interview attendance](https://github.com/GalvanizeDataScience/supervised-learning-case-study/blob/Denver/interview/case_study_description.md)


Near the end of the day you'll be asked to present capstone results from your project README.    
Please present:  
* Your problem statement  
* A description of your data  
* EDA and feature engineering  
* Your modeling approach  
* How you decided on your final model  
* Model results on unseen data  
* Relevance to the real world  
* Areas for future work  

Notes: 
Be wary of data leakage - unwittingly providing more information about your target in your 
dataset than would be available at the time of prediction.  Read more [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/data-leakage)

To determine real-world relevance, you usually need to bring in your out-of-model knowledge to 
quantify the cost-benefit of performance metrics.  Recall your profit-curve assignment!
